# CyberBridge History of Linux & Open-Source

## Introduction
Linux has a fascinating history that ties into the broader open-source movement. From its UNIX origins to the rise of free software, this guide explores the key events that led to the creation of Linux and its impact on modern computing.

## 1. The Birth of UNIX
The **heart** of an operating system is its **kernel**—the program that manages hardware and lets other programs use it.

### The Beginning (1969)
In the **late 1960s**, AT&T's **Bell Labs** was home to groundbreaking research in computing. Two programmers, **Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie**, created **UNIX**, an operating system designed for flexibility, portability, and multi-user capabilities.

At this time, computers were **the size of refrigerators**, and users interacted with them through **teletypes** (essentially electric typewriters connected to a computer). This was the **ancestor of modern terminals**.

### UNIX Spreads
Because UNIX was **distributed with its source code**, organizations could adapt it to their own hardware. This led to the creation of many UNIX-based systems, including:
- **HP-UX** (Hewlett-Packard)
- **Sun Solaris** (Sun Microsystems)
- **Xenix** (Yes, even Microsoft had a UNIX variant!)
 
### The Three Layers of UNIX
A UNIX-based OS has three major components:
1. **The Kernel** – The "heart" that manages hardware.
2. **The Shell** – The command-line interface for interacting with the OS.
3. **Utilities** – Programs used for performing tasks (e.g., `ls`, `cat`, `grep`).

## 2. The Free Software Movement & GNU
### AT&T Takes Control
In the **1980s**, AT&T decided that UNIX should no longer be freely distributed. They began **suing developers** of UNIX-like systems for copyright infringement, including the **University of California, Berkeley** (which had developed **BSD**, a popular UNIX variant).

This angered many in the computing world—especially a programmer at MIT’s AI Lab named **Richard Stallman**.

### Richard Stallman & GNU
Richard Stallman believed software should be **free** (as in freedom, not just price). His frustration with AT&T and proprietary software led to three major actions:
1. **The GNU Project** (1983) – A fully free, UNIX-compatible operating system.
2. **The Free Software Foundation (FSF)** (1985) – A group to promote and defend free software.
3. **The GNU General Public License (GPL)** (1989) – A legal framework ensuring software remains free.

**Fun Fact:**  
GNU stands for "**GNU is Not Unix**"—a recursive joke referencing its UNIX compatibility.

### The GNU System
The GNU Project created key components for a free operating system:
- **GRUB** (bootloader)
- **GCC** (C compiler)
- **BASH** (shell)
- **Core utilities** (commands like `ls`, `cp`, `rm`)

However, one crucial piece was missing: **the kernel**.

## 3. The Creation of Linux
While GNU had built most of an operating system, they struggled with the **kernel**—the critical component that controls hardware.

### Enter Linus Torvalds (1991)
A **student in Finland**, **Linus Torvalds**, was frustrated with the limited OS options available for his computer. So, just for fun, he started writing his own UNIX-like kernel.

What he **accidentally** created was **exactly** what GNU had been missing.

### The Birth of Linux
In **1991**, Linus Torvalds announced his project:
> "Hello everybody out there... I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like GNU) for 386(486) AT clones."

He made **Linux** (originally called "Freax") available for free, and soon, **developers around the world** started contributing.

### GNU/Linux: The Complete OS
With **GNU tools + Linux kernel**, a fully free UNIX-like OS was finally possible.

**Fun Fact:**  
Stallman argues the OS should be called **GNU/Linux**, since it combines GNU's software with the Linux kernel.

## 4. The Rise of Open-Source Software
### The Open-Source Movement
As Linux grew, developers realized **collaboration** was key. This led to:
- **The Open Source Initiative (OSI)** (1998) – Popularized the term "open-source."
- **Licensing beyond GNU GPL**, including MIT, Apache, and BSD licenses.

### Major Milestones
- **1993** – Slackware, the first Linux distribution.
- **1994** – Red Hat & SUSE bring Linux to businesses.
- **2000s** – Linux dominates **servers, supercomputers, and embedded systems**.
- **2008** – Android, built on the Linux kernel, revolutionizes mobile OSes.

## 5. The Impact of Linux Today
Linux powers **everything** from servers to phones. Some key areas include:

### **1. Supercomputers**
**100% of the world's top 500 supercomputers run Linux.**

### **2. Web Servers & Cloud Computing**
- **Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix** run on Linux.
- **Cloud platforms** (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) rely on Linux-based virtualization.

### **3. Embedded Systems & IoT**
- Linux runs on **TVs, smart devices, cars, and even Mars rovers**.

### **4. Desktop Computing**
- **Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora** – Popular desktop Linux distros.
- **Steam Deck** – A gaming console running Linux.
